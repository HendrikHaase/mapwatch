## Mapwatch isn't updating while I play - I have to re-upload client.txt to see changes.

**[Download Mapwatch](https://github.com/mapwatch/mapwatch/releases/latest) to see updates while you play!**

If you've used Mapwatch in the past, you'll remember the website used to update while you play. Sadly, Chrome version 81 broke this feature (2020 April 10-ish). **Updates while you play are no longer easily available in any web browser.** [The downloadable version of Mapwatch](https://github.com/mapwatch/mapwatch/releases/latest) still supports this.

For one-time analysis of your mapping history, the Mapwatch website works fine. The Mapwatch web site will not be going away.

### You said "not *easily* available in any web browser", and I don't want to download/execute your app.

I completely understand. If you're willing to run a line of code in the command prompt to hardlink the PoE log file to a second location, I might be able to get website updates working again for you soon - please follow [#51](https://github.com/mapwatch/mapwatch/issues/51).

If you don't know what a command prompt or a hardlink is: this won't work for you, [please download Mapwatch instead](https://github.com/mapwatch/mapwatch/releases/latest)!
