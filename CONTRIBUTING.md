## Contributing to Mapwatch

Happy to consider pull requests. Talk to @erosson before spending lots of time on one - accepting pull requests is not a sure thing, even when there's an open issue.

# Development

One-time setup (if this is broken, please talk to @erosson or file an issue):

* fork and clone the repository
* install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
* most Mapwatch code is written in Elm, so install [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html). Configure your editor to handle Elm code and run [elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format) on save. I mostly use [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-elm).
* finally, run `yarn` and your repository should be ready to use

Developing:

* run the website locally: `yarn dev:www`. Most website code lives in `packages/www/src`
* create a production build of the website: `yarn build:www`
* create a production build everything: `yarn build`
